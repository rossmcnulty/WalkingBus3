# WalkingBus3

This repository stores the Android application for the WalkingBus system. Anyone looking to utilize this repository must have:
1. A Firebase database configured to match the WalkingBus structure. This can be linked to automatically by Android Studio's Firebase tool.
2. A google-services.json file inside the app folder. This should be auto-included when linked to Firebase with Android Studio.
3. A GoogleMaps API key. This will be in app/res/values/google_maps_api.xml and should be cross-referenced in the AndroidManifest as a meta-data object.

The previous iteration of this repository (no longer updated) is stored at https://github.com/snehash/walkingbus.
